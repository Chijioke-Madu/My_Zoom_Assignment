Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Two models (AlexNet and VGG) agreed that the dog was a Walker hound, but ResNet classified it as an English foxhound.
So, not all three agreed, but two of them were close — all recognized it as a type of hound.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No — none of the three models classified the two dog images (one flipped) as the same breed.
This shows the models can be sensitive to orientation or lighting differences, which is common in image classification


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes — all three models correctly recognized that these images were not dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: AlexNet and VGG performed best overall.
They both correctly separated all dogs from non-dogs and produced one correct label match (“coffee mug”).
Between the two, VGG is typically preferred in practice because it tends to have deeper layers and slightly better feature extraction for visual detail — but both achieved equivalent scores here.
